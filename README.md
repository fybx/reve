# reve

Build your own desktop environment around a single script, with reve.

_(bash not included)_

## Get started with reve

1. Install reve by executing `install.sh`
2. Copy default mode-based chores from folder `chores/mode` or write your own using `examples/chore_script.sh`
3. Add reve installation folder to $PATH
4. Add a command to your window manager's configuration to call reve on launch
5. Set up a timer to call reve

## Details

- The installation script creates folder `reve` in `~/.local/bin/reve` and copies reve.sh as "reve" there.
- reve follows two principles: modularity and low resource use.
